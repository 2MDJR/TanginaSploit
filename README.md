# TanginaSploit
My first rubbish exploit made as a joke. This was originally thought as a learning concept on how to build programmes using Visual Studio Community 2022.
The concept came to mind in 14 July 2022 at about 2:13-19-ish PM. It took the first prototype 7 hours to make, and I took a break for 1 day.
The final committed exploit was started on 16 July 2022 at 7:14PM and compiled at around 9:12PM.

This uses the WeAreDevs API, and if the exploit is patched, the DLL is made to auto-update once the exploit has been unpatched. Usually 1-3 days because Roblox updates on wednesdays.
